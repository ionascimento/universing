Universing is a website to teach astronomical concepts in a simple way.

This is a project for my first year of technical graduation in software development at ETEC de SÃ£o Paulo. On this first year, I learned about HTML, CSS and Javascript and this project is a compilation of everything I absorbed.

## Pages

The project must have 20 pages, so I selected 10 themes and created both English and Portuguese versions. The index page detects your browser's language and automatically redirects you to the corresponding language page.
In every page I used ScrollRevealJS, a Javascript library that helps creating animations as the user scrolls through the page.

- Landing page
- Tutorials
- Earth movement
- The Moon
- Galileu Galilei
- Solar System
- Astronomical Units
- Light-years
- Playground (!)
- Quiz (!)

## Background

The pages's background is generated using Javascript's canvas to create random stars and moving comets. Each time you reload the page you will observe different star positions. If you continue looking at, you will see comets passing through the page. That was really fun to make.

## Playground

The most challenging part of the entire project was creating the playground. It's an interactive simulation of the solar system, where you can move and zoom through the planets and sun. It's also built with Javascript's canvas.

## Quiz

Another interactive page is the quiz, where you have 4 alternatives for each of the 10 questions. The quiz also includes a record tracking system, which is stored on LocalStorage.

    <h1>Galileo Galilei</h1>

    <p>Galileo Galilei was an important Italian astronomer, physicist and mathematician. It is considered a landmark of the scientific revolution in the fields of physics and astronomy. Galileo's studies were fundamental for the development of mechanics (the movement of bodies) and the discovery of planets and satellites. Founder of Modern Science and Father of Mathematical Physics, one of his relevant contributions lies, properly speaking, in the creation of the scientific method.</p>

      <p>"All truths are easy to perceive after they have been discovered; the problem is discovering them."</p>

    <h2>Discoveries</h2>

    <p>Defender of the Heliocentrism of Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543), Galileo refuted the ideas of Aristotle (384 BC - 322 BC), since he believed that the earth was not at the center of the universe (Geocentrism). In addition, in 1589, he published a text that disagreed with the theory proposed by the Greek philosopher about the weight of bodies in free fall. In this way, he showed that the speed of the fall does not depend on the weight of the bodies. He tried to measure the speed of light, but the equipment used was not able to make such a measurement.</p>

    <p>When he became aware of an instrument that allowed him to see objects at long distances, he built his own telescope. He managed to improve the equipment, reaching a magnification of 30 times, which allowed him to make numerous observations of celestial bodies. Among his astronomical discoveries are the relief of the Moon, the stellar composition of the Milky Way, the Satellites of Jupiter and the phases of Venus.</p>

    <h2>Galileo Galilei's Inventions</h2>

    <p>In addition to being a philosopher, teacher, physicist and astronomer, Galileo was an inventor. His creations helped him to deepen theories about the movement of bodies, inertia and the stars. As an example, we can mention: the pendulum clock, the binoculars, the astronomical telescope, the hydrostatic balance, the geometric compass, a calculator ruler.</p>

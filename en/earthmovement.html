    <h1>Earth Movement</h1>

    <p>Planet Earth performs two main movements. In a first movement, called a translation, it traces an orbit around the Sun. It also performs a rotation on its own axis, called a rotation. Each translation around the Sun represents a year, while each rotation around its own axis defines a day.</p>

    <h2>What is translation?</h2>

    <p>Translation is the movement of the Earth around the Sun. This occurs by the gravitational field generated by the mass of the Sun, causing the Earth to be stuck in its orbit. Thus, a complete revolution of the Earth around the Sun takes about 365 days, 5 hours and 47 minutes. The planet moves through space at an average orbital speed of 29.78 km/s. As the calendar year is only counted in days, a leap year is held every four years to compensate for the almost six annual hours that were left out. In it, one more day (February 29) is added to the calendar.</p>

    <p>The Earth follows a trajectory very similar to a circle around the Sun, but because it is not a perfect circle, it is called an elliptical trajectory. The average radius of Earth's orbit is 149.6 million kilometers. However, this number varies between two moments: perihelion, when the radius is 147.1 million kilometers and aphelion, the most distant moment, 152.1 million kilometers in radius.</p>
    
    <p>Contrary to what some people believe, the seasons do not occur because of the distance from the Earth to the Sun. The phenomena responsible for the changes of season are the solstices. That is, the position of each hemisphere in relation to the Sun. It is according to the solstice, that the degree of incidence of the sun's rays changes. In summer, there is a greater solar incidence due to the inclination of the Earth's axis in relation to the Sun. This occurs in the opposite way between the hemispheres. When it's summer in the southern hemisphere, it's winter in the northern hemisphere, when it's autumn in the southern hemisphere, it's spring in the northern hemisphere, and so on.</p>

    <h2>What is rotation?</h2>

    <p>Rotation is the movement that the Earth makes around its own axis. Each rotation of the Earth around itself takes 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4 seconds and 9 hundredths. Therefore, the day has twenty-four hours. The Earth's axis is an imaginary line that passes through the planet from the north to the south pole. This axis has an inclination of about 23.5 degrees.</p>

    <p>As the Earth rotates (counterclockwise), part of its surface is exposed to the Sun, being responsible for day and night. Taking the diameter of the Equator as a reference, it can be said that the rotational movement occurs at an average speed of 1674 km/h. This velocity cannot be felt within the atmosphere.</p>
